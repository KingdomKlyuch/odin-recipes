<h3>Holubtsi Recipe</h3>
<p>Pull a stool up to the table and make sure you're dressed comfortably, this home recipe is going to make 
    you want to stick around for a while. Fresh Ukrainian cabbage boiled, blankets a hidden treasure trove of 
    rice, ground meat (most popuularly a beef and pork duo), finely diced onions and carrots
    and a creamy paste made from ripe Ukrainian tomatoes. Each of these fine ingredients on their own is enough
    to make you kick of your penny loafers and loaf about feeling accomplished for the day. It is a hearty and
    rich food. Having said that, it is full of what you need to feel fueled like a jet engine shortly after. In
    typical Ukrainian fashion, good isn't good enough, so lets toss some spices, herbs and succulent sauce into
    the mix and make these babies sweat. Now that I've teased you and got you hungry
    lets cut to the chase, what's in them?
