<h3>Easy Tom Yum</h3>
<p>Alright, this is a little different than the other recipes. This is a soup that always brings me back 
    to the time I spent living at a Muay Thai training camp in Phuket, Thailand. It has a delicious 
    mixture of sour and spicy and never fails to leave me feeling satiated for hours to come. The version here
    is a quick and cheap fix if you want to throw together your own simple Tom Yum at home, more 
    traditional and whole recipes can have quite a bit of a learning curve to them. So if you want a simple home made 
    Tom Yum, lets do it.
